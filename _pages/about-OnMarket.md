### About Me 
___
I recently completed my Ph.D. in **Operations Research** at the Department of [Industrial and Operations Engineering](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu) of the University of Michigan (August 2022). I had the pleasure to be advised by Professor [Mark P. Van Oyen](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/van-oyen-mark-p/). I also obtained an MSc in **Statistics** at the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) of the University of Michigan. I have started a postdoctoral fellow position at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu). 

[comment]: <> (Prior to joining the University of Michigan, I earned an MSc in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from the University of Tehran.)

### Research Interests
___
My research interests lie at the interface of statistical machine learning and optimization. I am interested in designing data-driven analytical methods and sequential decision-making frameworks for a wide range of healthcare and business analytics applications.

My research is motivated by real-world needs and driven by many problems with both practical impact and interesting theoretical challenges. Over the years, I have collaborated closely with healthcare practitioners on several projects spanning from healthcare operations to medical decision-making.

<!---My research interests lie at the interface of statistical machine learning theory and data-driven optimization.
My current research aims to develop personalized decision-making methods through design
and analysis of online statistical machine learning and online optimization algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. My research problems are motivated by real-world problems in
healthcare operations, service operations management, medical decision-making, and supply chain.

* **Methodology**: Sequential Decision-Making under Uncertainty, Data-driven Optimization, Statistical Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Fairness & Interpretability in Artificial Intelligence
* **Applications**: Healthcare Analytics and Operations, Service Operations Management, Medical Decision-Making, Big Data and Business Analytics, Supply Chain Management-->

<!---My current research interests lie at the intersection of Statistical Machine Learning and Operations Research. I am interested in designing online learning and online optimization algorithms that learn over time to make effective decisions under an uncertain environment. My research is motivated by real-world needs and driven by many problems with both practical impact and interesting theoretical challenges. Applications of my research include Healthcare Operations Management, Personalized Medical Decision Making, and Business Analytics. My work has been applied to intensive care unit management, glaucoma, and diabetes.-->
