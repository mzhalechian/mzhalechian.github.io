### Mohammad Zhalechian
___
I am an Assistant Professor of [Operations and Decision Technologies](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/operations-decision-technologies/index.html) at the [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu). Prior to joining Kelley, I spend a year as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu). I received my Ph.D. in Industrial and Operations Engineering from the University of Michigan. Previously, I obtained an M.A. in Statistics from the University of Michigan. 

<!---under the supervision of [Mark P. Van Oyen](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/van-oyen-mark-p/). I also obtained an MSc in Statistics from the University of Michigan. -->

<!--- ### Research Interests
___
-->
I am interested in data-driven analytics to solve a wide range of problems in healthcare and service operations. My current research focuses on developing machine learning and optimization methods to make data-driven and informed decisions for a wide range of healthcare and service operations applications. 

My research is motivated by real-world needs and driven by many problems with both practical impact and interesting theoretical challenges. Over the years, I have collaborated closely with healthcare practitioners on several projects, spanning from deploying an online Bed Assignment Tool at the Michigan Medicine, designing a prediction tool Kellogg center and Medisoft at UK, to proposing a new regulatory guideline for the FDA's Premarket Approval Pathway.

<!---My research interests lie at the interface of statistical machine learning theory and data-driven optimization.
My current research aims to develop personalized decision-making methods through design
and analysis of online statistical machine learning and online optimization algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. My research problems are motivated by real-world problems in
healthcare operations, service operations management, medical decision-making, and supply chain.
<!---My research interests lie at the interface of statistical machine learning and optimization. I am interested in designing data-driven analytical methods and sequential decision-making frameworks for a wide range of healthcare and business analytics applications.-->
