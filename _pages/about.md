### About Me
___
I am an Assistant Professor of [Operations and Decision Technologies](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/operations-decision-technologies/index.html) at the [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu). Prior to joining Kelley, I spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu). I received my Ph.D. in Industrial and Operations Engineering from the [University of Michigan](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu). Previously, I obtained an M.A. in Statistics from the University of Michigan. 

I am interested in data-driven analytics to solve a wide range of problems in healthcare, service operations, and public policy. 
<!---under the supervision of [Mark P. Van Oyen](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/van-oyen-mark-p/). I also obtained an MSc in Statistics from the University of Michigan. ---->

### Research & Collaborations
___
My current research focuses on developing machine learning, human-AI interfaces, and sequential decision-making methods to make data-driven and informed decisions for high-impact problems.

My research is motivated by real-world needs and driven by many problems with both practical impact and interesting theoretical challenges. Over the years, I have collaborated closely with healthcare practitioners and hospitals on several projects, spanning from deploying an online Bed Assignment Tool at Michigan Medicine, designing a Prediction Tool for Tracking Glaucoma Progression at Medisoft in the UK, to proposing a new Regulatory Guideline for the FDA's Premarket Approval Pathway.

I am a research fellow at the [Center for the Business of Life Sciences](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/centers-institutes/business-of-life-sciences/index.html) and a faculty affiliate at the [Institute of Business Analytics](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/centers-institutes/business-analytics/index.html) at Kelley.
